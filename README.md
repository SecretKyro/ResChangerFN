I developed this project because I wanted to make playing Fortnite stretch resolution more convenient. 
Instead of manually switching back to 1920x1080 resolution after closing the game, this tool automates that process for you. 
Just remember to run the program with admin privileges for it to work properly.

PS. If you plan to use a custom resolution, be sure to set it up in your NVIDIA or AMD control panel first.
